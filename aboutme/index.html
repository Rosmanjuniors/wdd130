    <h2>Rosman Sanchez</h2>
    <h2>Junior</h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Rosman Sanchez, my family and friends call me 
        Junior. I currently live in Bolivar City - Venezuela, I am 28
         years old and I am looking for a degree in applied technology
          at BYUI. I have always been passionate about the area of 
          technology, parallel to these studies I am also studying the
          5th semester in Electronic Engineering. The knowledge of web 
          development and electronic project use them in the area of 
          Biomedicine.</p>

    <p>I am currently single, I play sports a lot, I usually read 
        a wide variety of books every month, and I go out to spend time
         with friends. I also enjoy serving in the Church, I have been
          a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
          since I was very young and had the joy of serving as a full-time
           missionary. During that time I really took special care of a 
           scripture: 1 Corinthians 13:13</p>
        
     <p>"And now abideth afaith, bhope, charity, these three; but the 
        greatest of these is charity."</p>
        
    <p>This scripture inexplicably spurs me to act with love and
         gratitude in everything I do. I hope that same feeling is an
          engine to move forward with faith in the goals that I have set 
          for myself and in the same way to make good friends along the 
          path. I wish you all the best of success.</p>
