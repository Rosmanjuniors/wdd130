                            <p>Psychotic disorders are a group of serious and complex mental illnesses that usually
                                manifest
                                during the transition period from childhood to adult life. They are characterized by the
                                presence of symptoms of the psychotic sphere as the core of the disease. Psychotic
                                symptoms
                                lead to a disconnection or distortion of reality in the person who suffers them,
                                generating
                                thoughts and perceptions in the individual that often do not agree with the reality that
                                we
                                can all perceive. At a general level, these symptoms cause an alteration in thought and
                                perception (visual, auditory, olfactory and/or tactile), as well as a set of emotional
                                and
                                behavioral difficulties that cause high stress and suffering in the affected person.</p>

                                experience directly or indirectly. For example, direct exposure may mean serious injury,
                                violence, or life-threatening danger. Indirect exposure can involve witnessing events
                                happen
                                to other people or learning about events that have happened to family members or close
                                friends. Affected people mentally relive the traumatic event, avoid anything that
                                reminds
                                them of it, and experience increased anxiety.</p>
