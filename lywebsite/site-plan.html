        Mental health care can preserve a person's ability to enjoy life.
        This is why it's important to have an arsenal of tools and support 
        available, so you feel empowered to overcome challenges and embrace 
        the growth that comes with them. The following resources can help you 
        begin to untangle what you are experiencing and find a path to a 
        positive life.</p>  
      <h4>MENTAL HEALTH </h4>
      <p>
        Various authors have said that mental health is the state of balance 
        between a person and their socio-cultural environment, for which it 
        can be said that they have well-being and that in turn enjoy a great 
        quality of life, and it is so, because, who enjoys mental health, not
        only enjoys a positive aptitude, but also knows how to handle and 
        face adversity in the face of adversity. Hence, it is directly 
        associated with the terms health and physical condition, although 
        mental health goes far beyond the physical part and state of a 
        person's body.</p>
      <h4>INFORMATION PRECEDES INSPIRATION - every person has a story.</h4>
      <p><em>
        "Regardless of our mental and emotional well-being, focusing on growth is healthier than obsessing about our shortcomings."
        Erich W. Kopischke
      </em></p>
      <p><em>
        "We can be oriented towards defense, security or fear. But, on the
         opposite side, there is the option of growth. Choosing growth 
         instead of fear twelve times a day means moving twelve times a 
         day towards self-realization."
         Abraham Maslow
      </em></p>  
      <h4>HOW TO GET HELP – You're not alone</h4>
      <p>
        Mental health leads us to have a positive image of ourselves which 
        can be improved by receiving support or treatment, which are 
        continuous processes that develop over time. The first step is to 
        ask for help.

      <h3>ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH</h3>
      <p>
        <h4><em>"All I know is that anyone who wants to can improve their well-being."
          Carl Rogers</em></h4>
        <p>
          According to the WHO, Mental health is a state of mental well-being 
          that enables people to cope with the stresses of life, realize 
          their abilities, learn well and work well, and contribute to 
          their community. It is an integral component of health and 
          well-being that underpins our individual and collective abilities 
          to make decisions, build relationships and shape the world we 
          live in. Mental health is a basic human right. And it is crucial 
          to personal, community and socio-economic development.</p>
  
        <h4>Warning signs</h4>
        <p>Experiencing one or more of the following feelings or behaviors 
          can be an early warning sign that you need to work on your mental 
          health:</p>
        <p>- Eating or sleeping too much or too little</p>
        <p>- Pulling away from people and usual activities</p>
        <p>- Having low or no energy</p>
        <p>- Feeling unusually confused, forgetful, on edge, angry, upset, worried, or scared</p>
        <p>- Having persistent thoughts and memories you can't get out of your head</p>
        <p>- Hearing voices or believing things that are not true</p>
        <p>- Inability to perform daily tasks like taking care of your kids or getting to work or school</p>
        <h4>Anxiety</h4>
        <p>Anxiety is a normal aspect of the emotional state of human 
          beings. It is a natural reaction of our body to what we perceive 
          as a threat –real or imagined–, and it allows us to face difficult 
          situations and survive. However, when it is not associated with a 
          reaction mechanism to deal with a problem, and also lasts over time 
          despite not being exposed to any danger, anxiety becomes pathological 
          and extends to all areas of life of those affected.</p>
        <h4>Eating Disorders</h4>
        <p>Eating disorders are a series of psychological illnesses that 
          cause the development of unhealthy eating habits. They could 
          start with an obsession with food, body weight, or body shape.</p>
        <h4>Stress Disorder</h4>
        <p>People with acute stress disorder have been exposed to a frightening 
          event, which they may experience directly or indirectly. For example, 
          direct exposure may mean serious injury, violence, or life-threatening 
          danger. Indirect exposure can involve witnessing events happen to other 
          people or learning about events that have happened to family members or 
          close friends. Affected people mentally relive the traumatic event, avoid 
          anything that reminds them of it, and experience increased anxiety.</p>
          <h4>Psychotic disorders</h4>
          <p>Psychotic disorders are a group of serious and complex mental 
            illnesses that usually manifest during the transition period from 
            childhood to adult life. They are characterized by the presence of 
            symptoms of the psychotic sphere as the core of the disease. 
            Psychotic symptoms lead to a disconnection or distortion of reality 
            in the person who suffers them, generating thoughts and perceptions 
            in the individual that often do not agree with the reality that we can 
            all perceive.

            At a general level, these symptoms cause an alteration in thought 
            and perception (visual, auditory, olfactory and/or tactile), as well 
            as a set of emotional and behavioral difficulties that cause high 
            stress and suffering in the affected person.</p>
